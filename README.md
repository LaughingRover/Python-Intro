# Introduction to Python

This repository contains materials for an introductory course on Python programming. The course covers Python fundamentals, including variables, control structures, functions, object-oriented programming, file handling, and a mini project that brings together the knowledge gained in the previous sections.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python, such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). These IDEs provide a user-friendly interface for writing, testing, and debugging Python code.
