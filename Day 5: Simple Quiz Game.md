# Simple Quiz Game

## Day 5


The program could present the user with a series of multiple-choice questions, randomly selected from a pool of questions. The questions and possible answers could be stored in a text file that the program reads in at the beginning. The user's score could be tracked as they answer each question, and the program could provide feedback on whether each answer is correct or incorrect.


To implement this game, you will need to use their knowledge of variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, data structures, and file handling.

Create a basic user interface for the game, using input and output statements to prompt the user for their answers and display feedback on their progress.

This project would provide an opportunity to practice your programming skills in a practical context, while also integrating and building upon the concepts covered in the previous days of the course.
